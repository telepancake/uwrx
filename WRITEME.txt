UWRX - A tool for running something

OVERVIEW

urwx runs as a supervisor of a process tree.
Supervisor
  registers as subreaper,
  initializes tmpfs directory where it will monitor, read and drain trace files,
  runs dns and proxy server logic,
  cleans up when subprocess finishes or when it is terminated.
It then launches the process that was given on command line after "--" in the
environment specified by the options.
During operation it collects and displays/saves traces from subprocesses.
Supervisor is responsible for updating read-write layers that have been modified. 

SUPERVISION

urwx intercepts most syscalls of the running subprocesses. It is done in-process, using separate manager thread
that itself does not have seccomp (and so can execute syscalls as well as start new subprocesses without seccomp).
Processes are launched under supervision as follows:
  uwrx loads, loads a copy of itself into upper available addresses and jumps there.
  this will be the managing thread that will communicate with supervisor uwrx and handle syscalls.
  it sets up the reduced free address space to launch ld.so obtained from PT_INTERP program header of the target executable.
  it loads and relocates the appropriate ld.so, sets up argv/env/auxv/tls/vdso and starts a new thread
  the new thread sets up seccomp unotify with _USER_INTERP to send syscall notifies to the manager thread
  manager thread optionally logs and uses _FLAG_CONTINUE to simply let  the syscalls proceed
  notable exceptions are
    starting new process. uwrx intercepts this to launch the subprocess so that it also has uwrx manager thread.
      this is also where skipping a process during partial rebuild happens.
    network operations. supervisor process is used to open all network sockets.
    file operations. intercepted to implement the layered, remapped filesystem view, as well as to suqash time and permissions
Manager thread communicates with the supervisor using "normal" IPC for things that require immediate handling,
as well as using low overhead high latency tracing buffers.

TRACING

uwrx writes (and optionally reads, on a replay) a trace. Trace contains information about processes,
what file and network operations they did, their arguments, what was written to stdout/stderr,
global parameters of the run and so on.

traces are kept in directories.
trace directories are organized under a "build" directory as build/<step>/<attempt>, with each step being a different
command, and each attempt being either a fresh rerun or a replay of another attempt.
step directory also contains:
  cmd - the command that was executed
  options - the urwx argument values (including the default/selected values for arguments that were omitted)

attempt directory has following files:
  perfetto - the trace events in perfetto format. COMPRESSION_TYPE_DEFLATE,
    custom timestamp_clock_id with is_incremental an TrackEventDefaults аre used to reduce trace size.
  ca.pem - mitm proxy CA certificate
  seed.txt - PRNG seed, in hex
  files/ - this is a directory with files that were modified by processes during this run of uwrx
    if files were deleted, a 0/0 char device whiteout is created, same as used in the overlayfs
    this way an overlayfs view of current state of this attempt can be constructed.
  net/<domain_name>/<path>/ ... /<path>/<file> - a file saved by proxy
  net/<domain_name>/<path>/ ... /<path>/<repo>.git/ - a bare mirror repository saved by proxy 
  net/<domain_name>/cert.pem - if there was https connection to this domain, this is the mitm certificate generated for it
  net/<domain_name>/ip4.txt - selected IPv4 loopback address for this domain
  net/<domain_name>/ip6.txt - selected IPv6 loopback address for this domain
  parent/<number> - a symlink to a parent trace. if there is more that one parent trace, they are stacked in increasing order.
    parent traces conceptually are commands that have been executed before the command in this trace in an unspecified order.
    all parents are collected recursively, then ordered in dependency order. having conflicting order (i.e. a loop) is an error.
    similarly, having two parent traces modify the same path if they are not ordered among themselves is an error (but since it
    is expensive to enforce, special command can be used to check for this)
    all "files/" directories of parents form layers of read only base directories, similar to overlayfs.
  replay - a symlink to a trace that is being replied. during reply events are still recorded, to debug inconsistencies, failures
    and to see impact of cached network requests and partial rebuild speedups.
    replay can have different set of parent traces (as a part of, say, edit/rebuild cycle)

Each monitor thread opens a file in a tmpfs directory created by the supervisor using it's pid as a filename.
Events to the file are written in perfetto trace format. To avoid syscall overhead per write, the file is mmaped in
a 1MB window using MAP_POPULATE, that advances forward by 1MB-MAX_EVENT_SIZE (rounded down to whole pages)
wherever writing offset is less that MAX_EVENT_SIZE from the end of the buffer after the write.
Supervisor periodically reads the directory to find new trace buffers, and uses kill() to check if process that created the buffer
still exists. if process does not exist, the file is read and processed completely and then deleted.
Otherwise, at least 1MB from the end of file (as can be determined by e.g. SEEK_HOLE) is left unprocessed, to avoid reading
partially written data.
Events are processed (filtered, printed if needed) and merged into one perfetto trace that is compressed and saved onto disk.
To avoid excessive tmpfs use, supervisor discards already read data by using fallocate with FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE and FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE
to discard completely read pages from the start of the file.

ISOLATION

Subprocesses do not access network directly.
When subprocess does dns lookup, supervisor records the lookup result, and, if it is successful, allocates new random loopback
IP address for each new domain. This allows tracking which TCP connection connects to which domain without looking at SNI,
as well as prevents connections to hardcoded IP addresses (except if whitelisted).
uwrx implements mitm proxy. it creates CA cert on startup that is recorded in the trace and placed in an overlay, in locations usually
used to store CA certificates.
when there is TLS connection, uwrx creates certificate for the domain name recorded by the DNS for the loopback address of this connection.
contents of the tls connection (all requests and responses) are recorded in the trace in plain text.

To simplify operation, requests that look like file downloads have the response body saved in the trace as a plain file,
under domain/path/filename path. Similarly, if connection used git:// protocol or looks like connection to a git server using
http(s), then a bare mirror repository is saved under domain/path/repo.git/ and then process is served the repo from that
mirror.

REPRODUCIBILITY

uwrx tries to make subprocess runs reproducible in many ways.
  Random is generated using hierarchy of PRNGs that has seed chosen and saved in the trace. This covers AT_RANDOM, /dev/urandom etc.
    on trace replay, random values are the same.
  Timestamps are the same for each filesystem layer. Lower layers are older, higher layers are newer. This has no relation to actual
    file timestamps on disk.
  Network connections are intercepted and replayed from the recorded, intercepted information.
  Time returns the same value.

NETWORK CAPTURE AND REPLAY

In capture mode, uwrx records events and caches network access that cannot be served from any parent trace.
In reply mode, there is no network access, everything is served only from the traces.
If trace has parent traces, they are always used for reply.
However, when there is a reply trace, new external requests can be disabled by an option.

PARTIAL REBUILD

When recording trace with parent traces, some processes can be skipped altogether, instead simply producing
their stdout/stderr output and exit status right from the monitoring thread of the parent.
Which processes can be skipped this way depends on the whitelist. By default it includes common compiler commands
such as cc, gcc and so on.
Process is skipped, if files and directories that it (and all it's subprocesses) accessed for reading have not changed.
There can be changes if replay has different set of parents that the command it is replaying.
 
INSPECTION

along with ability to use perfetto ui to inspect the trace, uwrx also has commands for inspecting the trace.
this allows seeing lists of files that were read/modified, lists and trees of processes,
summary stdout/stderr as well as per process output and so on.
There is also an interactive terminal UI that presents hierarchy of all launched processes, and allows
navigating and examinig each process and it's related entries.
