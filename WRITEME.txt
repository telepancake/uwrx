UWRX - A tool for running something

OVERVIEW

urwx runs as a supervisor of a process tree.
Supervisor
  registers as subreaper,
  initializes temp directory where it will monitor, read and drain trace files,
  runs dns and proxy server logic,
  cleans up when subprocess finishes or when it is terminated.
It then launches the process that was given on command line after "--" in the
environment specified by the options.
During operation it collects and displays/saves traces from subprocesses.
Supervisor is responsible for updating read-write layers that have been modified.

SOURCES

Processes need input files to work with. uwrx uses read-only sources as the base layer of the filesystem.
Without sources, processes would see an empty filesystem.

Sources are specified via command line:
  --source <dst>[:<priority>]=<source>

where:
  dst      - destination path where source is mounted (required)
  priority - ordering priority, default 0 (optional)
  source   - the source specification (required)

Source types (extensible, more can be added):
  /path/to/dir                    - host directory (initial implementation)
  tar:/path/to/file.tar[:/subpath] - tarball, optionally with subpath
  git:/path/to/repo[:treeish]     - git repository with optional treeish (default HEAD)
  oci:image:tag[:/subpath]        - OCI image, optionally with subpath
  squashfs:/path/to/file[:/subpath] - squashfs image, optionally with subpath

Examples:
  --source /src=/home/user/myproject
  --source /usr:-5=/nix/store/abc-glibc
  --source /opt=tar:/path/to/sdk.tar.gz:sdk-1.0
  --source /repo=git:/path/to/repo.git:main:src/ext

Source ordering (for overlapping paths):
  1. higher priority number wins (priority 50 beats priority 0, priority 0 beats priority -50)
  2. if same priority, later trace layers win (parent is overriden by a derived trace)
  2. if same priority and trace, longer dst path wins (more specific mount)
  3. sources are layered on top of each other, first match wins for file lookups

File resolution order during process execution:
  1. bundled data overlay for current bundled executable (if uwrx has bundled executables, and one of them is executing)
  2. files-<pid>/<path> (current run overwrites, pid <= current)
  3. files/<path> (current run first writes)
  4. sources (in priority order)
  5. parent traces' files-pid/ and files/ and sources directories
  - real filesystem is NOT directly accessible (isolation)

Source specifications are saved in the attempt's "sources" file for reproducibility.
On replay, sources must be available at the same paths with the same contents.

SUPERVISION

urwx intercepts most syscalls of the running subprocesses. It is done in-process, using separate manager thread
that itself does not have seccomp (and so can execute syscalls as well as start new subprocesses without seccomp).
Processes are launched under supervision as follows:
  uwrx loads, loads a copy of itself into upper available addresses and jumps there.
  this will be the managing thread that will communicate with supervisor uwrx and handle syscalls.
  it sets up the reduced free address space to launch ld.so obtained from PT_INTERP program header of the target executable.
  it loads and relocates the appropriate ld.so, sets up argv/env/auxv/tls/vdso and starts a new thread
  the new thread sets up seccomp unotify with _USER_INTERP to send syscall notifies to the manager thread
  manager thread optionally logs and uses _FLAG_CONTINUE to simply let  the syscalls proceed
  notable exceptions are
    starting new process. uwrx intercepts this to launch the subprocess so that it also has uwrx manager thread.
      this is also where skipping a process during partial rebuild happens.
    network operations. supervisor process is used to open all network sockets.
    file operations. intercepted to implement the layered, remapped filesystem view, as well as to suqash time and permissions
Manager thread communicates with the supervisor using "normal" IPC for things that require immediate handling,
as well as using low overhead high latency tracing buffers.

TRACING

uwrx writes (and optionally reads, on a replay) a trace. Trace contains information about processes,
what file and network operations they did, their arguments, what was written to stdout/stderr,
global parameters of the run and so on.

traces are kept in directories.
trace directories are organized under a "build" directory as build/<step>/<attempt>, with each step being a different
command, and each attempt being either a fresh rerun or a replay of another attempt.
step directory also contains:
  cmd - the command that was executed
  options - the urwx argument values (including the default/selected values for arguments that were omitted)

attempt directory has following files:
  perfetto - the trace events in perfetto format. COMPRESSION_TYPE_DEFLATE,
    custom timestamp_clock_id with is_incremental an TrackEventDefaults аre used to reduce trace size.
  ca.pem - mitm proxy CA certificate
  seed.txt - PRNG seed, in hex
  sources.txt - source specifications, one per line:
    <dst>\t<priority>\t<source_type>\t<source_spec>
    where source_type is: host, tar, git, oci, squashfs
    this allows reproducing the exact source configuration
  files/, files-<pid>/ - directory structure tracking file modifications per-process
    this is essential for partial rebuild: when determining if a process can be skipped, we need to know
    exactly which version of each file it read. if process A writes foo.txt, process B reads it, then
    process C overwrites foo.txt - we need B's input version preserved to correctly determine if B can be skipped.

    structure:
      files/<path>            - first written version of each file (original)
      files-<pid>/<path>      - overwrite by process <pid> (only if file already existed in files/)

    process pids are deterministic, allocated by uwrx (not actual OS pids):
      - supervisor is pid 1
      - spawned processes get 2, 3, 4, ... in spawn order
      - mapping to actual OS pids kept in supervisor
      - on replay, processes get matching pids from trace (handles racy scheduling)
      - if a non-matching process is started on reply, it gets "version-like" pid
        3.1 - a new unmatched process was launched before pid 4
        3.1.2 - on next replay, second of two unmatched processes that launched before pid 4
        inside managed processes, normal sequential pid values are used, that are translated to these
        strings by supervisor. the pid mapping (host/numeric internal/ordered string) is recorded in trace event

    when a process writes a file:
      - if file doesn't exist in files/: write to files/<path>
      - if file already exists in files/: write to files-<pid>/<path>

    this keeps most files directly in files/, per-pid directories only for conflicts.

    if files were deleted, a 0/0 char device whiteout is created, same as used in overlayfs.

    during process P execution, file reads resolve as follows:
      1. check bundled data overlay for the currently running bundled executable (if uwrx has launced a bundled executable)
      2. find all files-<pid>/<path> where pid <= P (versions written by P or before P ran)
      3. use the one with largest such pid
      4. if none exist, use files/<path> (the original first version)
      6. check sources of this trace (in priority order)
      5. if not in files/ or sources at all, check parent traces' files-<pid>/ and files/ and sources
      - real filesystem is NOT directly accessible (isolation)

    no need to record pid for files in base files/ - pid ordering determines visibility:
    if P's pid is smaller than all files-<pid>/ containing the file, and P has modified a file, that file is in base files/.

  net/<domain_name>/<path>/ ... /<path>/<file> - a file saved by proxy
  net/<domain_name>/<path>/ ... /<path>/<repo>.git/ - a bare mirror repository saved by proxy 
  net/<domain_name>/cert.pem - if there was https connection to this domain, this is the mitm certificate generated for it
  net/<domain_name>/ip4.txt - selected IPv4 loopback address for this domain
  net/<domain_name>/ip6.txt - selected IPv6 loopback address for this domain
  parent/<number> - a symlink to a parent trace. if there is more that one parent trace, they are stacked in increasing order.
    parent traces conceptually are commands that have been executed before the command in this trace in an unspecified order.
    all parents are collected recursively, then ordered in dependency order. having conflicting order (i.e. a loop) is an error.
    similarly, having two parent traces modify the same path if they are not ordered among themselves is an error (but since it
    is expensive to enforce, special command can be used to check for this)
    all "files/" directories of parents form layers of read only base directories, similar to overlayfs.
  replay - a symlink to a trace that is being replied. during reply events are still recorded, to debug inconsistencies, failures
    and to see impact of cached network requests and partial rebuild speedups.
    replay can have different set of parent traces (as a part of, say, edit/rebuild cycle)

Each monitor thread opens a file in a temp directory created by the supervisor using it's pid as a filename.
Events to the file are written in perfetto trace format. To avoid syscall overhead per write, the file is mmaped in
a 1MB window using MAP_POPULATE, that advances forward by 1MB-MAX_EVENT_SIZE (rounded down to whole pages)
wherever writing offset is less that MAX_EVENT_SIZE from the end of the buffer after the write.
Supervisor periodically reads the directory to find new trace buffers, and uses kill() to check if process that created the buffer
still exists. if process does not exist, the file is read and processed completely and then deleted.
Otherwise, at least 1MB from the end of file (as can be determined by e.g. SEEK_HOLE) is left unprocessed, to avoid reading
partially written data.
Events are processed (filtered, printed if needed) and merged into one perfetto trace that is compressed and saved onto disk.
To avoid excessive temp space use, supervisor discards already read data by using fallocate with FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE and FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE
to discard completely read pages from the start of the file.

ISOLATION

Subprocesses do not access network directly.
When subprocess does dns lookup, supervisor records the lookup result, and, if it is successful, allocates new random loopback
IP address for each new domain. This allows tracking which TCP connection connects to which domain without looking at SNI,
as well as prevents connections to hardcoded IP addresses (except if whitelisted).
uwrx implements mitm proxy. it creates CA cert on startup that is recorded in the trace and placed in an overlay, in locations usually
used to store CA certificates.
when there is TLS connection, uwrx creates certificate for the domain name recorded by the DNS for the loopback address of this connection.
contents of the tls connection (all requests and responses) are recorded in the trace in plain text.

To simplify operation, requests that look like file downloads have the response body saved in the trace as a plain file,
under domain/path/filename path. Similarly, if connection used git:// protocol or looks like connection to a git server using
http(s), then a bare mirror repository is saved under domain/path/repo.git/ and then process is served the repo from that
mirror.

REPRODUCIBILITY

uwrx tries to make subprocess runs reproducible in many ways.
  Random is generated using hierarchy of PRNGs that has seed chosen and saved in the trace. This covers AT_RANDOM, /dev/urandom etc.
    on trace replay, random values are the same. PCG is used due to it's features (multiple streams) and simplicity.
  Timestamps are the same for each filesystem layer. Lower layers are older, higher layers are newer. This has no relation to actual
    file timestamps on disk.
  Network connections are intercepted and replayed from the recorded, intercepted information.
  Time returns the same value.

NETWORK CAPTURE AND REPLAY

In capture mode, uwrx records events and caches network access that cannot be served from any parent trace.
In reply mode, there is no network access, everything is served only from the traces.
If trace has parent traces, they are always used for reply.
However, when there is a reply trace, new external requests can be disabled by an option.

PARTIAL REBUILD

When recording trace with parent traces, some processes can be skipped altogether, instead simply producing
their stdout/stderr output and exit status right from the monitoring thread of the parent.
Which processes can be skipped this way depends on the whitelist. By default it includes common compiler commands
such as cc, gcc and so on.
Process is skipped, if files and directories that it (and all it's subprocesses) accessed for reading have not changed.
There can be changes if replay has different set of parents that the command it is replaying.
 
INSPECTION

along with ability to use perfetto ui to inspect the trace, uwrx also has commands for inspecting the trace.
this allows seeing lists of files that were read/modified, lists and trees of processes,
summary stdout/stderr as well as per process output and so on.
There is also an interactive terminal UI that presents hierarchy of all launched processes, and allows
navigating and examinig each process and it's related entries.

BUNDLED EXECUTABLES

uwrx can be built as a multi-executable bundle, similar to busybox but using uwrx's own mechanisms.
this allows uwrx to be distributed as a single binary containing a complete toolchain.

Bundle structure:
  uwrx binary contains:
    - uwrx supervisor and manager code (the uwrx itself)
    - bundled executables sections: statically linked, relocatable binaries (e.g., gcc, ld, as, ar)
    - bundled data sections: compressed filesystem overlay with files normally installed with those programs
      (headers, libraries, specs files, etc.)

Bundled executables must be:
  - statically linked (no external dependencies)
  - position-independent / relocatable (can run from any address)
  - all needed data files should be bundled in corresponding data section

Execution of bundled programs:
  when manager thread intercepts execve() for a bundled executable:
    - instead of loading from filesystem, locate the executable in uwrx's bundled section
    - the executable is already loaded in high memory as part of uwrx
    - transfer directly to the bundled executable's entry point
    - no need to read from filesystem or allocate new memory for code

File access for bundled programs:
  when a bundled program reads files (e.g., gcc reading headers):
    - the bundled data section corresponding to the executable provides an implicit source layer
    - this layer has highest priority (checked before all other sources)
    - contains files that would normally be installed with the program:
      /usr/include/*, /usr/lib/gcc/*, etc.

Bundle creation:
  uwrx provides a command to create bundles:
    uwrx bundle --output <path> --add <name>=<executable> --data <source>

  the bundle command:
    - takes uwrx as base
    - adds specified executable to a new bundled executables section
    - adds data overlay to a new bundled data section
    - produces a new uwrx binary with everything included

Symlink/hardlink invocation (like busybox):
  if uwrx is invoked via a symlink named after a bundled executable:
    uwrx automatically runs that executable under supervision
  example:
    ln -s uwrx gcc
    ./gcc -c foo.c    # equivalent to: uwrx run -- gcc -c foo.c
  In this mode (uwrx followed by a command without preceeding --, or through a symlink), no supervisor is started and
  no traces are written, to allow using included binaries normally.

File resolution with bundles (updated order):
  1. bundled data overlay (implicit, highest priority)
  2. files-<pid>/<path> (current run overwrites, pid < current)
  3. files/<path> (current run first writes)
  4. sources (in priority order)
  5. parent files and sources 
  - real filesystem is NOT directly accessible (isolation)
